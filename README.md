# Employee-Payroll-System

#1. Brief Introduction (What the Project Is)
"I developed an Employee Payroll System using Java, applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system manages employee records, calculates salaries, and generates payroll reports. It ensures accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability using encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism."

#2. Key Features (What It Does)
Stores Employee Information (ID, Name, Salary, Department, etc.).
Calculates Salaries (including bonuses, deductions, taxes).
Supports Different Employee Types (Full-time, Part-time using inheritance).
Encapsulates Data (secure access to employee details using getter/setter methods).
Generates Payroll Reports (for salary details and employee records).
Modular and Scalable (can be extended with GUI or database).








The **Employee Payroll System** is a Java-based application using **OOP concepts** to manage employee records, calculate salaries, and generate payroll reports. It automates salary computation, tax deductions, and net pay calculations, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. The system reduces manual errors, streamlines payroll processing.
